    This is a fully armed and operational Cat Fact station!<br/><br/>

    Future goals are to develop a back end to see recipient responses, add options for sloth and horse facts (and other types of facts), and add automated voice calls. Also, look into other APIs to see if a Google voice or  Plivo number could be plugged in to send free messaging.<br/>
    One day time will allow!<br/>
    Any money spent on texts is going directly to Twilio and Openshift for text service and server hosting.<br/>
    I hope you find this idea as entertaining as I did.<br/>
    When I first saw the reddit thread a while ago, I knew it would be a fun project and I learned a lot from making it.<br/>
