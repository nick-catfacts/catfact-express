    This site is a fully armed and operational Cat Fact service! <br/><br/>
    I developed it from the ground up and would love to put more time into it, but I need food and other stuff so had to put it on hold for now.<br/><br/> Goals would be to develop a back end to be able
    to see recipient responses, add options for sloth and horse facts and other animal facts, and add automated voice calls to more FULLY bring animal facts into peoples lives.<br/><br/>
    Any money spent on texts is going directly to Twilio and Openshift for text service and server hosting. I would like (at some point) to look into Google voice APIs to see if a Google voice number could be plugged in to send free messaging.<br/><br/>
    I hope you find this as entertaining as I and my friends found it. When I first saw the reddit thread a while ago, I knew it would be a fun project and I learned a lot from making it.<br/><br/>
