    Hi, I'm a software developer and this site is a fully armed and operational prototype for a Cat Fact service. <br/><br/>
    I developed it from the ground up and would love to put more time into it developing a back end to be able
    to see responses, add the options for sloth and horse facts, and add automated voice calls to more FULLY bring cat facts into peoples lives.<br/><br/>
    But I need food and other stuff so had to call it a day on this site.<br/><br/>
    This is not a money making thing for me. Any money spent on texts is going directly to Twilio and Openshift for text service and server hosting.<br/><br/>
    I hope you have some fun with it. When I first saw the reddit thread a while ago, I knew it would be a fun project and I learned a lot making it.<br/><br/>
    Any questions, comments, concerns, please hit me up at nickkiermaierATgmail.com or head to the github repo here: <a href="http://nkiermaier/catfacts"> http://nkiermaier/catfacts </a>.<br/><br/>

    See ya later meow.
