    This site is a fully armed and operational Cat Fact station!<br/>
    Future goals are to develop a back end to see recipient responses, add options for sloth and horse facts (and other types of facts), and add automated voice calls to more FULLY bring animal facts into peoples lives.<br/>
    One day time will allow!<br/>
    Any money spent on texts is going directly to Twilio and Openshift for text service and server hosting.<br/>
    I would like to look into Google voice APIs to see if a Google voice number could be plugged in to send free messaging.<br/><br/>
    I hope you find this as entertaining as I did.<br/>
    When I first saw the reddit thread a while ago, I knew it would be a fun project and I learned a lot from making it.<br/>
    Any questions, comments, concerns, please hit me up at nickkiermaierATgmail.com or head to the github repo here: <a href="https://github.com/nkiermaier/catfacts"> https://github.com/nkiermaier/catfacts </a>.<br/><br/>

    See ya later meow.
